tech-survey

EDA Component :
1. Explore the columns like Gender , Country, State, Treatment, no_employee,
remote_work,mental_vs_physical , comments , TimeStamp, Age.
2. Explore the column to detect the outliers in them and try to delete or add data into the outliers.
3. Find out the null values and fill the null values with data.
4. We calculate the mean, median, mode and standard deviation for all the main columns like Age
and Gender and detect the outliers and work to reduce them.
5. Plot the visualization plot to show distributions of the age_group , Gender_distribution,
Treatment_distribution, No_of_employee V/S company size

Modeling Component:
1. Use a set of features for predicting whether or not a employee requires treatment or not, based
on the other features in the data set.
2. The use the models like Logistic Regression, K nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree Model, Random
Forest Model. Test out the best accuracy model out of the four models.
